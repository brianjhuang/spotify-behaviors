	Using sklearn to generate a model that would predict skipping behavior allowed for
	data from different users to become a general prediction. In the real world, this
	is not accurate as every listener has their own unique taste and skipping behavior.
	In other words, we simply cannot assume that everyone shares the same behavior through
	sampling from the whole dataset.

	Rather, it must be recognized that each listener has their unique listening styles.
	Therefore, it is essential that we sample the listening behavior of each specific listener
	in order to determine traits that shape the skipping behavior of listeners.

	st.markdown("""
	For our demo, recommendations were generated using Cosine similarity, taking in user data
	and grouping the songs they listened to with the user. We generated a similarity function
	to train a system that takes in a group of songs and their features, and outputs what songs
	users are most likely to listen/are most similar to what our persona users will listen to.

	However we still ran into the problem of grouping users by their listening activity.
	One of the biggest problems when making our predictions, people listen to songs in order,
	and those songs impact what they listen to next. We did not have time to implement the
	weight of song sequencing, which could've improved our predictions a ton, as knowing how
	people listen to songs provides crucial information. If we had more time, we could explore using
	Markov chains in the future to account for sequencing.

	We solved this problem of the "superuser" using k-means clustering for each user in our recommendation class.

	st.markdown("""## __Data, Privacy, and Other Issues__""")

	st.image("../spotify_streamlit_photos/privacy.jpeg")

	st.markdown("""
	Our dataset was large, far larger than any dataset any of us had worked with up this point.
	With well over 500GBs of data, our team was tasked with hours of sampling, cleaning the data
	using PySpark, and leaving our devices open overnight to extract data samples of usable size.
	Balancing the size of the sampled data while preserving the integrity of the data was a major time sink.
	Thankfully, due to PySpark and the Mac application Amphetamine (which kept our laptops awake long enough
	to sample overnight), we were able to sample workable sets of data.

	In an attempt to add a bit of spice to our project, we attempted to fetch the actual song names
	from the Spotify API. This, however, resulted in a grim discovery. The data returned, since
	it's user data, had the track IDs encoded. This meant there was no way for us to retrieve tracks.
	On top of that, that meant that many songs were encoded with unique IDs, meaning that the same song
	would have a different ID. This made building out our recommender system difficult as it introduced
	unnecessary redundancy that we couldn't resolve when clustering the data. In the future, we can avoid
	this by extracting the data ourselves, rather than relying on an existing set.

	As with all recommendations, we cannot account for users who have no prior history, or tracks
	we have never seen before. We were unable to deal with the Cold Start problem, and simply allowed
	our algorithm to give it's best guess when it came to dealing with this issue.
